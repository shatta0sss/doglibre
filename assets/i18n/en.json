      "title": "Just What Is DogLibre?",
      "1": "It’s a fully-fledged dog care ecosystem, powered by hilarious memes and community interaction. After presale completion, it will continue to expand and launch utility-based initiatives, as opposed to relying solely on meme generation. DogLibre was launched by dogs, for dogs - just look at our",
      "2": "K9 Defense Force."
    },
    "2": {
      "title": "What Are the USPs of DogLibre?",
      "1": "DogLibre is a meme with a mission. It leverages the power of AI-generated memes, the public’s love of dogs, and the experience of a dedicated team to offer a new form of presale. While most degen meme tokens are funny, they have no real framework for translating any gains back into real-life utility. Let’s scale meme content and take it worldwide."
    },
    "3": {
      "title": "Is The DogLibre Presale Safe?",
      "1": "DogLibre is backed by a well-known and powerful",
      "2": "Stray Savior Squad (‘SSS’)",
      "3": "with extensive experience, not to mention the",
      "4": "K9 Defense Force.",
      "5": "Plus, it has a clear roadmap, lots of public information, and transparent tokenomics. It boasts industry-leading developers and has an expert marketing team behind it."
    },
    "4": {
      "title": "How is DogLibre Different?",
      "1": "DogLibre will be an industry-leading meme token with a major focus on improving doggie welfare across the planet. It will be rescuing strays and taking care of them, with real-life recordings of the animals for a personalized touch, not to mention doggie welfare research, doggie daycare centers, and exclusive ‘conversations with dogs’ podcasts."
    },
    "5": {
      "title": "What Are The DogLibre Tokenomics?",
      "1": "There are maximum supply of 500T $DOGL with 8% available in the 2024 presale. The starting price is a tiny 0.00000050 in round one. In total, 15% goes to staking rewards, 12% to gaming rewards, 18% to the treasury, 10% to liquidity & launchpool, 10% to R&D & Ops, 10% to marketing, 7% to partnership and 10% to team with cliff and vesting period."
    },
    "6": {
      "title": "What are the Benefits For Token Holders?",
      "1": "The $DOGL token has multiple incentive mechanisms. It is heavily discounted in the presale, especially in the early stages. Tokens will be burned to promote price appreciation. Due to its meme connotations, $DOGL has the potential to rival 1000x coins like Shib and Doge.",
      "2": "Plus, $DOGL has many layers of utility including in-game payments, donations, voting, breeding, community rewards, exclusive access to content, etc. When the ecosystem is fully operational, the token can be used as an industry-specific coin exclusive to the dog care sector. Woof!"
    },
    "7": {
      "title": "When Can Tokens Be Claimed?",
      "1": "Tokens can be claimed after the presale is complete - this is standard within the presale industry. Token holders can also benefit from immediate staking rewards. After the sale is complete and the dogs are well fed, the token is expected to launch on major CEX/DEX exchanges and continue operations to expand its influence."
    },
    "8": {
      "title": "Why Is Pepe Here?",
      "1": "You might have spotted Pepe the Frog in some of our memes. He approached us when he heard we were launching a presale that promoted freedom for dogs. He was very upset at the way that Doge and Shib were getting all of the attention.",
      "2": "Just because he had no fur or tail, he was treated as a second-class citizen all his life. It’s why he ultimately went down the degen route to gain love and attention.",
      "3": "But we are non-discriminatory at DogLibre. Who says only dogs can have freedom? We love all animals, even if we prefer our Huskies and Pomeranians. Pepe is welcome to join us in our memes and can follow us if he chooses, as a valued community member."

    "intro_2": "With a woof and a bark, a new initiative was launched that would change the fate of the world forever, combining the ROI potential of meme coins and the stability of an organized team with specific utility-driven goals. It will culminate in a DAO for the democratized allocation of funds for global dog care. ",
    "intro_3": "Ultimately, the aim is a $1 billion market capitalization, a 1000x price increase, and a massive expansion with the help of key influencers and branding specialists. The difference is that funds are funneled back to utility-based initiatives that make a real-life impact on the quality of dog care. ",
    "intro_4": "Token holders will benefit from real-life yield from hard petcare assets including shelters, facilities, petcare, accessories, etc. Though still under development, DogLibre is the only Web3 Project focused exclusively on dogs, and users will have a say in how funds are best allocated to man’s best friend. Libre comes from a French term meaning “freedom”, which is what we’re all about!",

    "para_2": "In addition, we are seeking to reinvent the way that dogs are assisted. The traditional charity donation model is inefficient with high costs and a lack of transparency.

    "para1_desc1": "Largecap meme coins such as Doge and Shiba Inu have dominated the market. This has led to a plethora of dog-based meme spinoffs that have done tremendously well in the markets. The issue is that none of these tokens actually return profits to the real world. So it’s a hollow victory.",
    "para1_desc2": "Another huge concern is that such meme coins are highly discriminatory. There are far more dogs aside from Shiba Inu and Doge. DogLibre is the only meme-focused soon-to-be DAO that treats all dogs equally well without preference for any one particular breed of dog.",
    "para2_desc1": "Dog discrimination is a prominent problem within the wider meme community, and many breeds can develop emotional and mental complexes at the thought of being left out. DogLibre hopes to put an end to this discrimination once and for all! No Dog is ever left behind. Whether it's a Great Bernard or a Chihuahua, all are treated as equals with DogLibre.",
    "para2_desc2": "Doge and Shiba Inus have gotten disproportionate publicity due to the success of certain meme tokens. This kind of centralization is not good for the market and monopolies always need to be broken up to promote equality within the wider economy.",
    "para3_desc1": "We also decided to include Pepe in our project, after he explained to our team lead that he felt victimized and isolated due to Doge/Shib discrimination. She didn’t have the heart to turn him away, and he has been with us ever since! You might spot him in some of our visual assets.",
